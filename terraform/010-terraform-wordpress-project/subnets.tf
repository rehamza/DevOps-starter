#Certainly! Below is an example of how you can extend your Terraform script to create a VPC with one public subnet and one private subnet. Additionally, it includes the creation of an EC2 instance in each subnet â€“ one for WordPress and one for MySQL.

# Create a private subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "private_subnet" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.vpc_wordpress.id
  cidr_block        = "15.0.144.0/20"
  availability_zone = "us-east-1b" # Change the availability zone as needed

  tags = {
    Name = "Private Subnet"
  }
}
